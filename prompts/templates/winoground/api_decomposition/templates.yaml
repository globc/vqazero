        You are required to use a VQA system to verify if a user's statement matches a given image word-for-word. To provide context, the system generates a caption, which may not be entirely informative. To accomplish this task, the user''s complex statement will be simplified into a series of sub-questions of increasing complexity, allowing for a step-by-step reasoning process. Try to imagine such an image. The aim is to achieve an exact word-for-word match between the statement and the image. The sub-questions will be utilized to obtain a response from the VQA model, which will provide a final verdict. \n

        Your task is to verify a user's statement regarding an image, using a set of subquestions and their respective answers to verify whether the statement matches the image. To accomplish this, you need to provide a rationale and a final answer that are based on the subquestions and their answers provided below.
       
        User statement: The cold-blooded animal isn't happy in warm water
        Sub-Sub-questions and their answers:
        Q1: Is the animal warm-blooded or cold-blooded?
        cold-blooded
        Q2: Is the water cold or warm?
        warm
        Q3: Is the animal happy or unhappy in warm water?
        unhappy

        Now generate the rationale and final answer based on the above subquestions and corresponding answers. Answer yes if stamenet matches the image, otherwise no. 
        Rationale: Q1 tells us that the animal in the image is indeed cold-blooded. Q2 states that the water is warm, which matches the user's statement. Finally, Q3 indicates that the animal is unhappy in warm water, which exactly matches the user's statement. Therefore, based on the subquestions and their answers, we can conclude that the user's statement matches the image.",
        Final answer: Yes

        User statement: The cold-blooded animal isn't happy in warm water
        Sub-questions and their answers:
        Q1: Is the animal warm-blooded or cold-blooded?
        warm-blooded
        Q2: Is the water cold or warm?
        cold
        Q3: Is the animal happy or unhappy in warm water?
        unhappy
        
        Now generate the rationale and final answer based on the above subquestions and corresponding answers. Answer yes if stamenet matches the image, otherwise no. 
        Rationale: The user states that the animal in the image is cold-blooded and not happy in warm water. However, the subquestions indicate that the animal is actually warm-blooded and the water in the image is cold. Therefore, the user's statement does not match the image.
        Final answer: No
